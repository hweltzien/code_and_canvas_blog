## Description
   The Code and Canvas Blog was created with developers in mind. It is a space to join a community of developers, write about technical concepts, and view existing posts abut recent advancements or new technologies. The blog uses PostgresSQL, Sequelize, and Node.js to provide a functional Express.js API. Users can add an image to their post using Cloudinary API. The front end uses Handlebars as the templating engine and Tailwind CSS for styling. 

## Installation
    Run npm install and npm run seed in the terminal.
    
## Usage
    Run node server.js in the terminal. Test API routes in Insomnia Core to create, update, and delete data in the database.
